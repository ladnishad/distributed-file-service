# distributed-file-service

A distributed file service consisting of a server process and three clients. Each client process connects to the server over a socket. The server handles all three clients concurrently. Clients designate a directory on their system to serve as their shared directory. Any file placed into that directory is automatically uploaded to the server. Once the server receives the new file, it sends that file to the remaining clients. Clients place the received file into their shared directory.

There are paths to directories of either server or the client, please change the path to whatever location youâ€™ve saved the files to.
